## About

Chest radiography, like many diagnostic medical exams, produces a long-tailed distribution of clinical findings; 
while a small subset of diseases is routinely observed, the vast majority of diseases are relatively rare. 
This poses a challenge for standard deep learning methods, which exhibit bias toward the most common classes at the expense of the important but rare "tail" classes. 
Many existing methods [3] have been proposed to tackle this specific type of imbalance, though only recently has attention been given to long-tailed medical image recognition problems. 
Diagnosis on chest X-rays (CXRs) is also a multi-label problem, as patients often present with multiple disease findings simultaneously; 
however, only a select few studies incorporate knowledge of label co-occurrence into the learning process. 
Since most large-scale image classification benchmarks contain single-label images with a mostly balanced distribution of labels, 
many standard deep learning methods fail to accommodate the class imbalance and co-occurrence problems posed by the long-tailed, 
multi-label nature of tasks like disease diagnosis on CXRs.

The CXR-LT challenge tasks will feature two main tasks: (i) long-tailed, multi-label classification and (ii) zero-shot generalization to previously unseen disease findings.
